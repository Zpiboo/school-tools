# School tools
Useful tools for school.
## ⚠️ Warning
This project is in developpement,
I am using Github because it is useful and
because it allows me to test it when coding
on my mobile phone (dont judge me pls).

I am coding this for personal purposes,
this is why everything is wrote in french.
It may be shared one day, and if this ever
happens, I will add a language selection
(if anyone speaks something else than english
and french, if you could translate
it would help me a lot :D).
